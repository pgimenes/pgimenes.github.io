I am a PhD student in Deep Learning Systems at Imperial College London. My work blends hardware, systems and algorithms in topics spanning **LLM reasoning**, **heterogeneous distributed systems** and **Machine Learning compilers**. My CV is available [here](https://pgimenes.github.io/files/Pedro_Gimenes_CV.pdf).

I am a regular committer in open-source Machine Learning projects such as [Mase](https://github.com/DeepWok/mase). Outside work, I like learning languages and practicing Muay Thai. I also occasionally read books and write about them [here](https://pgimenes.github.io/blog/).
