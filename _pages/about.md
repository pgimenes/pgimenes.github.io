I am a PhD student in Deep Learning Systems at Imperial College London. My work blends hardware, systems and algorithms in topics spanning **agentic reasoning**, **adaptive inference serving systems** and **Machine Learning compilers**. My CV is available [here](https://pgimenes.github.io/files/Pedro_Gimenes_CV.pdf).

:robot: I am a regular committer in open-source projects such as [Mase](https://github.com/DeepWok/mase).  
:weight_lifting_man: I enjoy weightlifting and Muay Thai.  
:books: I occasionally read books and write about them [here](https://pgimenes.github.io/blog/).
